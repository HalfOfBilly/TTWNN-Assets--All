This product requires the following:

CD-ROM Drive
MSCDEX CD-ROM Extensions Version 2.1 or later
640K Base RAM, with at least 500K available
Register Compatible VGA Card with at least 256K RAM

This product will utililse the following:

2 or 3 Button Mouse (Driver must be loaded before starting)
CD-ROM With CD-Audio playing facility
Creative Labs SoundBlaster or SoundBlaster Pro Card

To take full advantage of the multimedia effect of this product, you need at
least a CD-ROM drive with audio playing capability connected to suitable
speakers. Audio is played both through the CD-Player and the SoundBlaster
card, (sometimes simulaneously), so you should have both connected to
speakers, or mixed into the same set of speakers.  If you do not have a
SoundBlaster card, you will not get many of the sound effects in the program,
and the Multimedia effect will be lessened.

If you have a mouse, the left mouse button will have the same effect as
"Button A" in the instructions, if you point to an item and press the
left mouse button that item will be displayed or acted upon.  The right
mouse button has the same effect as "Button B" and will take you back to
a previous screen.

Moving the mouse will move the pointer on the screen.

If you do not have a mouse, the pointer can be moved by the arrow keys and the
keys on the numeric keypad.  The arrow keys will move the pointer in the
required direction, and the keys on the keypad will allow you to move both
straight and diagonally.

If you are without a mouse, the '+' key on the keypad will act as "Button A"
and the '-' key on the keypad will act as "Button B".

Other keyboard equivalents for "Button A" are:

Key 'A'
Key 'F1'

Other keyboard equivalents for "Button B" are:

Key 'B'
Key 'F2'

Whilst using the product, the normal "Ctrl-Alt-Del" function will not be
active.  If you wish to quit from the product type "Ctrl-ESC"

The INSTALL.EXE program will create a batch (.BAT) file that will run the
product (as long as the correct CD-ROM is installed) with your chosen options.

If you do not have a hard disk or do not want to install onto it, you may
run this product from the CD-ROM by logging onto the CD-ROM drive and
typing "RUN <drive>" where <drive> is the drive letter of your CD-ROM
drive, e.g. "RUN D" if your CD-ROM is drive D.
This will only work if you want the product to run in the
english language, and your SoundBlaster Card is configured for the default
settings, if you need non-standard settings, you must use INSTALL to create
a custom file for you.

If the product will not load, this will probably be because there is not
enough free memory available in your system to run it.  You should try removing
unnecessary device drivers and "BUFFERS=" lines from your CONFIG.SYS, while 
removing any lines from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file that load in memory resident
software.  Note that if the program runs out of memory during operation, it
will beep once from the loudspeaker and exit to the MS-DOS prompt.

Certain CD-ROM drives are not fully multimedia compatible and do not operate
correctly if the SoundBlaster card is used to play sampled sound effects at
the same time as they are accessing the disk.
As a full Multimedia product, Town With No Name obviously does
this a great deal.  If you have difficulties with the program, such as
random crashes, garbage appearing on screen or system hangs, and you have
eliminated lack of memory as a possible cause, try re-running the install
program and selecting the option to disable ALL digital sampled sound effects
(note that simply saying 'No' to the 'Do you have a SoundBlaster card'
question is not sufficient).  If this cures the problem, you should contact
your CD-ROM supplier and see if an updated driver is available for your drive.
